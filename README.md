# Data Science Notebooks Project

This project consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks on various data science topics. The aim is to provide clear, concise, and practical demonstrations and explanations on each topic. The notebooks are intended to be shared on LinkedIn and other social media platforms to benefit a wider audience.

## Folder Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains all the Jupyter notebooks, organized by data science topics such as data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning, visualization, etc.
- `data/`: For storing datasets or other relevant data that the notebooks might use.
- `images/`: For storing any visuals, like plots or diagrams, created from the notebooks or any other relevant imagery.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and choose a topic of interest.
2. Open the desired notebook to view the content and run the code cells.
3. Datasets used in the notebooks can be found in the `data/` directory.
4. Any generated or relevant images can be found in the `images/` directory.

Feel free to share, modify, or suggest improvements!
